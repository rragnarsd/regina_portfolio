**Behind the Scenes of This Portfolio**

Building this portfolio came with a few challenges and plenty of learning:

- ⚡ **Making it feel alive:** Added a smooth loading spinner. Flutter web doesn’t play nicely with HTML/Bootstrap, so a little creativity was needed.

- 🔒 **Keeping secrets safe:** My contact form uses EmailJS. `.env` files don’t work with GitHub Pages, so I had to find a secure workaround.

- 🚀 **Automating updates:** Every push to the main branch now auto-deploys via GitHub Actions. Setting this up taught me a lot about Flutter web builds and CI/CD.

Each challenge was a lesson, and now the portfolio is live, polished, and fully functional.
